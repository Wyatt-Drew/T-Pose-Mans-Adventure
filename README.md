# T-Pose-Mans-Adventure
T-Pose-Mans-Adventure was built as part of a school project to "showcase a wooden model in a variety of positions".  I challenged myself to learn as much as I could about 3D game design in a few days. 

## Deployment
The application is deployed and accessible [here](https://wyatt-drew.github.io/T-Pose-Mans-Adventure/index.html).
